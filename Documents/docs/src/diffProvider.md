# DiffProvider Module Documentation

## Overview
The `diffProvider` module is responsible for managing file differences within the extension. It provides functionality to display differences between original and modified file contents, apply changes to files, and generate HTML representations of these differences for user-friendly viewing.

## Functionality
The `diffProvider` module includes the following key functionalities:

1. **Show Diff**: Displays the differences between the original and modified content of a file.
2. **Apply Changes**: Applies the modified content back to the original file.
3. **Generate HTML Diff**: Creates an HTML representation of the differences for better visualization.

## Key Functions

### `showDiff(filePath: string, originalContent: string, modifiedContent: string): Promise<void>`
- **Description**: This function takes the file path, original content, and modified content as parameters. It generates a temporary document for the modified content and invokes the VS Code diff command to display the differences.
- **Parameters**:
  - `filePath`: The path of the file being compared.
  - `originalContent`: The original content of the file.
  - `modifiedContent`: The modified content to compare against the original.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves when the diff view is displayed.

### `applyChanges(filePath: string, newContent: string): Promise<boolean>`
- **Description**: This function applies the new content to the specified file path. It updates the file with the modified content and saves the changes.
- **Parameters**:
  - `filePath`: The path of the file to be updated.
  - `newContent`: The new content to write to the file.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the changes were successfully applied.

### `generateDiffHtml(originalContent: string, modifiedContent: string): string`
- **Description**: This function generates an HTML representation of the differences between the original and modified content. It highlights added, removed, and unchanged lines for clarity.
- **Parameters**:
  - `originalContent`: The original content of the file.
  - `modifiedContent`: The modified content to compare.
- **Returns**: A string containing the HTML representation of the differences.

## Example Usage
```typescript
const diffProvider = new DiffProvider(workspaceRoot);
await diffProvider.showDiff('example.ts', originalContent, modifiedContent);
const success = await diffProvider.applyChanges('example.ts', modifiedContent);
const diffHtml = diffProvider.generateDiffHtml(originalContent, modifiedContent);
```

## Conclusion
The `diffProvider` module plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience by providing clear visual feedback on file changes. Its ability to show differences and apply modifications seamlessly integrates into the overall functionality of the extension, making it a vital component for users working with code.
