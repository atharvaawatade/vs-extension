# Debug Utils Module Documentation

## Overview
The `debugUtils` module provides utility functions for logging debugging information and testing file editing functionality within the extension. It is designed to assist developers in diagnosing issues related to file edits and to ensure that the editing features work as intended.

## Functions

### logDebug
```typescript
static async logDebug(message: string, data?: any): Promise<void>
```
- **Description**: Logs debugging information to a specified log file. It includes a timestamp and can optionally log additional data.
- **Parameters**:
  - `message`: A string containing the message to log.
  - `data`: An optional parameter that can contain any additional data to log.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves when the logging operation is complete.

### testFileEdit
```typescript
static async testFileEdit(workspaceRoot: string, filePath: string): Promise<boolean>
```
- **Description**: Tests the file editing functionality by attempting to open a specified file, apply a simple edit, and save the changes. It logs the actions taken during the process.
- **Parameters**:
  - `workspaceRoot`: The root directory of the workspace.
  - `filePath`: The path of the file to test.
- **Returns**: A promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the file edit was successful.

## Usage
The `debugUtils` module is primarily used during the development and testing phases of the extension. It helps developers track down issues related to file handling and provides a mechanism to verify that file edits are applied correctly.

## Example
```typescript
// Logging a debug message
await DebugUtils.logDebug('File edit initiated', { filePath: 'src/example.ts' });

// Testing file edit functionality
const success = await DebugUtils.testFileEdit('/path/to/workspace', 'src/example.ts');
if (success) {
    console.log('File edit test passed.');
} else {
    console.log('File edit test failed.');
}
```

## Conclusion
The `debugUtils` module is an essential part of the extension's development toolkit, providing necessary functions for logging and testing file edits. By utilizing this module, developers can ensure that the extension behaves as expected and can quickly identify and resolve issues.
