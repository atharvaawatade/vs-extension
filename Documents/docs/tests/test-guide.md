## Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of the development process for ensuring the quality and reliability of the extension. This guide outlines the strategies and practices that should be followed to effectively test the extension.

## Testing Strategies

- **Unit Testing**: Focus on testing individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between different modules to ensure they work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Simulate user interactions with the extension to verify that the entire workflow functions as intended.

## Best Practices

- Write tests alongside your code to ensure that new features are covered.
- Keep tests small and focused on a single behavior or functionality.
- Use descriptive names for test cases to make it clear what is being tested.
- Regularly run tests to catch issues early in the development process.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for the extension, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal in your development environment.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Use the following command to execute the tests:

   ```
   npm test
   ```

4. Review the output for any failed tests and address the issues accordingly.

## Writing Tests

When writing tests, consider the following:

- Use a testing framework such as Mocha or Jest.
- Structure your tests in a way that mirrors the structure of your codebase.
- Include setup and teardown logic as needed to prepare the environment for tests.

## Debugging Tests

If you encounter issues while running tests, use the following strategies to debug:

- Add console logs to your tests to track the flow of execution and variable values.
- Use a debugger to step through the code and inspect the state at various points.
- Review the error messages provided in the test output for clues about what went wrong.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that the extension is thoroughly tested and maintain a high standard of quality throughout the development process.
